Revision history for Perl extension XML::Pastor 
0.54 Sat Jul 05 2008
	- Added some more examples to documentation. Also brought some clarity, hopefully. 
	- Fixed incorrect sprint_xml_element calls in XML::Pastor::Schema::Parser (it should have been imported from XML::Pastir::Util)
	_ XML::Pastor::NodeArray has been refactored to Data::HashArray which is now a separate module.
	- XML::Pastor::NodeArray->hash() can now accept CODE references as key fields. 
	- Attributes are now prefixed with an underscore '_' in the element hash. 
	  Attribute accessors follow the same pattern. However, non-prefixed accessor aliases
	  are provided when this doesn't conflict with a child element name.
