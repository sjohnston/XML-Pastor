Revision history for Perl extension XML::Pastor 

0.6.2 Sun Jul 13 2008
	- Added a test case for mode offline/multiple.
	- Added POD generation in mode offline/multiple.
	- Further fixed the 'use' statements in sub-modules (they are almost all within the package declaration now), for Test::Unit's sake.


0.6.1 Sun Jul 13 2008
	- Somehow, the Pastor generated mathworks test modules had made it to the MANIFEST. Fixed it.
	 
0.6.0 Sat Jul 12 2008
	- Changed versioning scheme. It's now on two dots.
	- Builtin::boolean  boolify OVERLOAD was not working properly. Fixed it.
	- Data::HashArray was missing from the required modules in Makefile.PL. Fixed it.
	- Code refactoring from XML::Pastor::ComplexType and XML::Pastor::SimpleType into XML::Pastor::Type
	- Added John Micco's 'product.xsd' schema to the test suite
	- Moved the use statement to within the package declaration in XML::Pastor to help Test::Unit's loader (as requested by John Micco from Mathworks).
	- Fixed a bug that prevented the correct 'use' statements to be generated in generated code (Thanks to John Micco from Mathworks)
	- Added support for simpleContent elements (those that a have a simple content but possibly with attributes).
	
0.54 Sat Jul 05 2008
	- Added some more examples to documentation. Also brought some clarity, hopefully. 
	- Fixed incorrect sprint_xml_element calls in XML::Pastor::Schema::Parser (it should have been imported from XML::Pastir::Util)
	_ XML::Pastor::NodeArray has been refactored to Data::HashArray which is now a separate module.
	- XML::Pastor::NodeArray->hash() can now accept CODE references as key fields. 
	- Attributes are now prefixed with an underscore '_' in the element hash. 
	  Attribute accessors follow the same pattern. However, non-prefixed accessor aliases
	  are provided when this doesn't conflict with a child element name.
